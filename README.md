# **MATLAB Cheat Sheets:smile:**


A few cheat sheets I made for myself that I use for doing any math equations or mathmatics in general. ~~totally not because i took a fixation in matlab recently~~


In the .md files you will find cheat sheets I have created related to the following: An overall college mathematics, Linear Algebra, Discrete Mathematics, Geometry, Stastics, Physics and a begineers starter sheet as well.  

An example of how I formatted is as  follows:

On the left is  the  math type and the function name  and the  definition of what is does is  on the right.

| Function Name | Definition |
| :---: | --- |
| **Symbolic Math** | |
| ðŸ’¡ `syms` | Define symbolic variables for algebraic manipulations. |
| Example: `syms x y` |
| ðŸ’¡ `solve` | Solve algebraic equations symbolically. |


I  hope to continue to add more to this and expand :D
